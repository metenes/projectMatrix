# projectMatrix
This project aims to develop a simple MatLab-like application which is able to do Matrix Calculations and Linear Algebra
How I get this idea is a bit wierd, 
I'm into quantum computation and while I was looking the "Introduction to quantum mechanics / David J. Griffiths", I have realized there are a good amount of
Linear Algbra is required to understand the wave mechnanics at least partially. (Bohr, I know...). 
So, I asked myself why I don't develop a basic linear Algebra application on c++. I will try to improve as the way goes on ...
